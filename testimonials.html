      The Culin Karate Center is an excellent place. Me and my son took classes there and loved it. I miss that place very much it was a big part of my life. Thank you Mr Culin for everything.

This is a gem. The first lesson begins as you step through the doors, love and respect for yourself and others. I have been a part of many other great well minded schools; this school has a great mixture fun but with respect, discipline, structure, and strength that undoubtedly leads only to success and accomplishment in martial arts and life. The instructors are very knowledgable, patient, and supportive with every student during class; no one is left behind. Every level has the same love and respect. This is a great source of family fun and building.
